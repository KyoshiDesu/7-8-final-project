        <h2>Project Experience</h2>
        <p>Throughout this project, I discovered that creating a website is more than just assembling code—it's about problem-solving and paying attention to details. One challenge I faced was aligning elements using Flexbox; initially, the layout didn't appear as I intended. By revisiting my CSS and experimenting with different properties, I managed to achieve the desired alignment. This experience taught me the importance of perseverance and the value of trial and error in problem-solving.</p>
        <p>Moreover, I realized that the skills I've acquired—like structuring content with HTML and styling with CSS—are not only applicable to web development but also enhance my overall analytical thinking. In 2025, as technology continues to evolve, understanding how to engineer solutions using existing tools is invaluable. This project has shown me that attention to detail and a methodical approach can lead to successful outcomes, skills that are transferable to many real-life scenarios.</p>

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>I learned that small details in code—like missing a semicolon or forgetting to close a tag—can break the whole page. One problem I ran into was that my images weren’t showing up, and I didn’t know why. After checking everything, I realized I spelled the file name wrong by one letter. Fixing that taught me how important it is to double-check my work carefully. This project made me realize that being detail-oriented isn’t just for coding—it helps in lots of subjects like math, science, and writing.</p>
        <p>Before starting the website, I planned the layout in my notebook and listed the sections I wanted to include. I used tools like HTML for the structure, CSS for the style, and Flexbox to organize the content. I also added custom fonts and images to make it look nice. I had to engineer a solution when I wanted my navigation menu to scroll to each section of the page. It took some trial and error to figure out how to link it correctly. I think being an engineer means solving problems step by step and not giving up when things get tricky.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Even though AI can build websites, I think it’s still important to know how to code because it helps you understand how things really work. When I built my own site, I learned what each part of the code does, so I could make changes or fix things myself. If I only relied on AI, I might not catch mistakes or be able to customize things the way I want. Plus, learning HTML and CSS helps train your brain to think logically and creatively. Just like using a calculator doesn’t mean you shouldn’t learn math, I think learning code helps me stay in control.</p>
        <p>This project helped me grow as a student because I had to stay focused and work independently. There were a lot of steps involved, so I had to manage my time and keep track of what I finished. I used problem-solving, creativity, and even writing skills when I wrote the reflection. I learned that I do better when I break big tasks into smaller parts and check my progress as I go. I think the skills I practiced—like patience, organization, and critical thinking—will help me in other subjects too, especially in group projects or anything that needs planning.</p>
